Stuff still to do:

- emailing comments
- entry wiki
- FTP file drop

- last_modified and last_comment_id on diary entry

General ideas:

- Image sizes in tags on entry screen
- Let entrants be able to choose a primary screen shot. This screenshot will
  be shown as a thumbnail next to their name on the main page. (Easier to
  remember a picture than to remember someone's nick or game name.)  Or at
  least, show the picture on the entry vote page.  
- Might also be nice to display the scores you gave a user next to their
  name as well.  
- on the main pyweek 2 page, if a diary entry has an image in it, put a
  thumbnail of that image next to it -- make it easy for people to spot
  entries with neat looking screenshots, etc.
