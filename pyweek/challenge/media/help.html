<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make sure you have working versions of the libraries you're going to use.</li>
<li>Make sure you can build packages to submit as your final submission (if
you're going to use py2exe, make sure you know how to use it and that it
works).</li>
<li>If you don't have access to Linux, Windows or a Mac to test on, contact
friends, family or other competitors to find someone who is able to test
for you.</li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Plan on spending at least several hours packaging and testing your
packaging.</li>
<li>Allow time for planning your game (for example 1/5 of the total time)</li>
<li>Allow time for polishing the game by adding instructions, opening menus,
level transition screens, game over screen (for example 1/5 of the total
time)</li>
<li>Upload screenshots and put them in diary entries!</li>
<li>Hang around in the IRC channel, irc.freenode.net channel #pyweek</li>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13" id="how-to-submit-your-entry" name="how-to-submit-your-entry">9. How to submit your entry</a></h1>
<p>Visit your entry's page any time during the challenge and up to 24 hours
after the finish to upload your file(s). You may upload as many files
as necessary, including screenshots.</p>
<p>The server will become heavily loaded at deadline times. Given that there
is an entire 24-hour period in which to upload your files after the
challenge finishes there will be no leniency for failure to upload.</p>

<p>Consider the advice at <a class="reference" href="http://www.pygame.org/wiki/distributing">http://www.pygame.org/wiki/distributing</a></p>
<p><strong>We recommend you download</strong> the <a class="reference"
href="http://media.pyweek.org/static/skellington-1.9.zip">Skellington 1.9</a> package and use that as the starting-point
for your game.</p>
<p>For this challenge,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Always use either ZIP or TAR / GZIP to bundle your entry.</li>
<li>Always use a top-level directory.</li>
<li>You <strong>MUST</strong> include a README.txt which at a minimum indicates:<ul>
<li>who wrote the code</li>
<li>who created the artwork</li>
<li><em>how to run the game</em></li>
<li>the licence for the game (the Free Software Foundation has a handy
<a class="reference" href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses">page of free software licenses</a>)</li>
<li>what dependencies need to be installed</li>
<li>a plug for the challenge is nice :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If possible, you should bundle other libs you've used. If it's pure
Python, then it may be bundled straight. If not, then consider including
the source for the library.</li>
<li>If your entry is large (greater than 1MB) then you might want to use
the <a class="reference" href="http://media.pyweek.org/static/pyweek-upload.py">pyweek uploader</a> script to upload it, as it will handle bigger
uploads better.</li>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19" id="what-s-pyweek-all-about" name="what-s-pyweek-all-about">15. What's PyWeek all about?</a></h1>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.mechanicalcat.net/richard">Richard</a> speaks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I created PyWeek after competing in and running several Ludum Dare 48-hour
challenges. I had a few problems with the format of that challenge:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Being over 48 hours meant that you had to focus on the game for most, if
not all of the 48 hours. This can be difficult for some of us to
organise. Spreading the development over a week is much easier.</li>
<li>I wanted to be able to collaborate with friends and LD48 is a solo-only
challenge.</li>
<li>There's lots of public-domain or Creative Commons artwork and audio out
there that people shouldn't be prevented from using. Also, I suck at both
drawing and musical composition :)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Python-only stipulation was partly as an experiment (to see whether we'd
get more games that worked for more people than the LD48 experience) and
also as a tool for promoting Python (which I think rocks, a lot).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PyWeek number 1 was conceived in about May or June 2005 and run in August 2005.</p>
<p>It's run by Richard. Lucio Torre has helped out by updating the site code
from pre-magic-removal to post-magic-removal versions of Django.</p>
<p>The participation in PyWeek has been increasing gradually since the start:</p>
<div id="placeholder" style="width:600px;height:300px;"></div> 
<p>The first challenge was announced about 3 months out, and a bunch of
people registered that didn't return for the challenge, hence the low
number of finished entries. Since then registration has only been opened
to new users one month from the start date. This appears to have reduced
the number of unused registrations.</p>
