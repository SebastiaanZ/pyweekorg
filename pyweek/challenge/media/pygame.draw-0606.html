<h1>Pygame.draw challenge</h1>

<p><strong>Download the <a href="pgd-200606.zip">submissions</a>!</strong></p>

<h2>THE CHALLENGE:</h2>

<p>Create a game in up to 64kbytes of source code using only pygame (and
python stdlib). No additional libraries, no external files
(even ones loaded from a network).
That means no PyOpenGL, no PNGs, no OGGs, etc.</p>

<p>Feel free to jump on IRC @ freenode.net channel #pyweek. I hope to have
a wiki up soon.</p>

<h2>THE DEADLINE:</h2>

<p>Start as soon as you read this announcement.</p>

<p>Human-readable, Linux-compatible, single .py file entries must be
received by <a
href="mailto:richard@pyweek.org">richard@pyweek.org</a> before
UTC midnight (23:59) on the 25th of June, 2006. The deadline used to be
AEST but I changed my mind and everyone gets a few extra hours :)</p>

<p>Multiple entries are allowed. Teams are allowed.
Monkeys are allowed! Ponies, sadly, are not allowed.</p>


<h2>THE RESULTS:</h2>

<p>All entries will be posted to a page on the <a
href="http://www.pyweek.org/">PyWeek
website</a>.</p>

<p>Entry gameplay instructions and license must be included in the source or
in the game itself.</p>

<p>I will probably choose one of the entries as my favourite, and declare this
in various obscure fora and private email messages. No other mention of
rankings or favourites will be made.</p>


<h2>THANKS:</h2>

<p>Thanks to Phil Hassey for the challenge inspiration!</p>
